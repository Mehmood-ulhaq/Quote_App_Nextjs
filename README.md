## Getting Started
To get started with this project clone this repository to your local machine

## Requirements
- Create an app that fetches quotes from any open-source API such as [API Ninja Quotes API](https://api-ninjas.com/api/quotes) and displays them in a list. The user should be able to remove a certain quote from the list, fetch quotes and clear all qoutes in the list.
- Add authentication to the app where sign-in page is a public page and the quotes page is a protexted page. The authentication should be in browsers state.
- Add your own custom functionality that further enhances the app. You can be as creative as you want with it.
- Use SSR as much as possible in the app and style it using tailwind css.

## Upload to Github and deploying to vercel
After you are finished you can upload the code into a public repository and also deploy the app to vercel. Share links to both github repository and vercel with us.
